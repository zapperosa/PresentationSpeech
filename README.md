Description of an Elevator Pitch ....

> Good morning ladies and gentleman, we are a group of young informatic engineering students, and our project consist in resolving problems for those who have a vehicle. It consist in placing some sensors around the car in order to have a full track of the vehicle(medium velocity, consumption, GPS localization and more global variables). This track will be available for different clients such as insurance vehicle companies, renting vehicles companies, vehicle manufacturating companies, companies which uses company vehicles and particular customers. For every different segment of clients, our project will have different advantages.
In order to bring this project to the right harbour, we've first thought in design an efficient software which will be connected with the hardware(sensor) and all the registred data by the sensor will be processing at our server network and when the customer wants to collect all the information since the last time the customer had requested information,
the customer will have to pay a little fee and then a report of the tracking will be send.
